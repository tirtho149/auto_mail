## üåü How to Run
### 1. Setup Configuration:
Before running the script, you need to set up the configuration parameters:
- **Sender's Email Address (`from_addr`)**: Update this variable with the email address from which you want to send the emails.
- **Email Credentials (`email` and `password`)**: Assign values to these variables with your email credentials.
- **Email Template (`template_path`)**: Customize this variable to point to your email template file. The script will use this template to compose the emails.
- **Recipient Data (`data_path`)**: Modify the `data_path` variable to specify the path to your CSV file containing recipient data, including email addresses and any other relevant information.
- **Column Names (`email_column` and `name_column`)**: Adjust these variables to match the column names in your CSV file corresponding to email addresses and recipient names.
- **SMTP Server Settings (`smtp_server` and `smtp_port`)**: Customize these variables to match your email provider's SMTP server address and port.

### 2. Running the Script:

Upon execution, the script will read the CSV file, connect to the SMTP server, and send personalized emails to the specified recipients using the provided email template.

### 3. Monitoring:
The script logs its activity to a file named `email_sender.log`, located in the same directory as the script. You can monitor this file for information on successful email sends and any encountered errors.
